# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage the operations of a library efficiently. It allows users to perform various tasks such as adding books, adding users, displaying available books, checking out books, returning books, and searching for books.

## Features

### Adding Books

Users can add new books to the library database by providing details such as title, author, genre, and availability status.

### Adding Users

Users can be added to the system with their details including name, contact information, and a list of borrowed books.

### Displaying Books

The system provides the functionality to display all the books available in the library, along with their details such as title, author, genre, and availability status.

### Checking Out Books

Users can borrow books from the library by providing the title, author, and book ID. The system checks the availability of the book and updates its status accordingly.

### Returning Books

Users can return borrowed books to the library. Once returned, the availability status of the book is updated in the system.

### Searching Books

The system allows users to search for books by title or book ID, providing convenient access to specific books in the library collection.

## How to Use

1. **Compile**: Compile the Java source files using any Java compiler. 

2. **Run**: Run the compiled Java program.

3. **Follow Instructions**: Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various tasks such as adding books, adding users, displaying books, checking out books, returning books, and searching for books.

## Data Storage

The system stores book and user information in a text file named `LibraryManagementSystemfile.txt`. This file serves as the database for the application, enabling data persistence across sessions.

## Note

- Ensure that the Java runtime environment is installed on your system to execute the program.
- Make sure the text file `LibraryManagementSystemfile.txt` is present in the same directory as the Java source files.
